# Food Truck Ninja 🌭🌮🍔🥙🤺

Are you tired of eating the same thing over and over again? Well guess what, its food truck time! Easily explore the many hidden food trucks around your city like a ninja 🤺🤺🤺

***Note from author:*** 
>**foodtruck.ninja is at its very early stages of development** so do not expect it to be fully functional (for now of course). That being said, if you would like to help develop, please do!

## Getting Started

If you just want to become a food truck ninja, head over to [foodtruck.ninja](https://www.foodtruck.ninja) to recieve your first food belt (See what I did there? 😎)

If you are a code monkey, then please sit down and keep reading. You code money better be ready to develop in JS (hold your breath) as this is a full JavaScript stack application (react, mongodb & node).

### Prerequisites

Alright code monkey, this is what you need to get installed in your monkey machine:

- NodeJS 8.10 or above
- NPM  5.6 or above
- A good web browser (aka Google Chrome)


### Installing

Start by cloning this repo:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/camilo86/foodtruck.ninja
```

Navigate inside the project and install the dependencies with NPM:

```bash
cd foodtruck.ninja
npm install
```

At this point you will be ready to run the project locally:

```bash
npm start
```

### Coding style

To keep your monkey fingers from writting bananas, this project uses `eslint`. Commits and pull requests **will** check for code style. Make sure your editor/IDE has `eslint` configured. You can also check your code style with the following command:

```
npm run lint
```

## Additional information
